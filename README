This project contains a very basic Android port of ccnfileproxy.

==RUNNING & TESTING==========================================================

1. Start with default settings (serve /mnt/sdcard at ccnx:/ccnfileproxy)
2. Start ccnd on your laptop
3. From computer: ccndc add / tcp <phone_ip>
4. To see what's inside the directory, from computer: ccnexplore -root /ccnfileproxy
5. To get files, use ccngetfile on your computer


==COMPILE & INSTALL==========================================================

Tested SDK: android-sdk-r16

You must compile ccnx/ and the projects inside ccnx/android so that make can link 
to ccnx/javasrc/ccn.jar and ccnx/android/CCNx-Android-Lib/bin/classes.jar

In the Makefile, modify ANDROID_LIB and JAVASRC to your local folders

$ make setup
$ make

CCNx-Android-Services must be installed prior to running CCNx-Android-FileProxy.
If you have trouble starting CCNx-Android-Services, force quit the application 
and try again. If that doesn't work, restart your phone.

$ adb install bin/CCNx-Android-FileProxy
